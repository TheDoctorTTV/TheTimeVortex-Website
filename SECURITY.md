## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, report it privately using one of the following methods:

- **GitHub Security Advisory**: [Submit a report here](https://github.com/TheDoctorTTV/TheTimeVortex-Website/security/advisories/new)  
- **Email**: thedoctor@thetimevortex.net  

We aim to respond within **48 hours** and will provide updates as we investigate.  
If the report is valid, we will work on a patch and coordinate responsible disclosure before making the details public.

- You will receive confirmation of your report within 48 hours.  
- Security fixes will be prioritized and released as quickly as possible.
