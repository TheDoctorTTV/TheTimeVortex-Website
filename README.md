A fast, static hub for our creator group.

## Project structure

The project is now organized into dedicated folders to make assets easier to find:

- `pages/` â€“ all HTML documents for the site, grouped together (including creator subpages).
- `assets/styles/` â€“ shared CSS files.
- `assets/scripts/` â€“ browser JavaScript shared across pages.

Existing image folders such as `backgrounds/`, `icons/`, and `PFPs/` remain available at the project root for compatibility with deployed content.
