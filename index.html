                Hello, I’m TheDoctor, this site is a place to learn more about me and stay connected through my YouTube,
                Twitch, Discord Server or other of my Social Media. My lore is that I am a Time Lord who became a Demon
                Lord and on my 121,027th
                regeneration. <br><br>
                I’m a massive weeb who has watched countless anime, keeps up with new releases, and dives into tons of
                manga and light novels. Fun fact: I built this entire website myself using HTML—no Wix, Squarespace or
                anyother website builders
                used. (No offense to those who use them.)
